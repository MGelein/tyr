# Tyr - Online Combat Organizer
[Tyr](https://tyr.interwing.nl) is a simple combat organization tool developed to make the job of a Dungeon Master in D&D a little simpler. No need to count hitpoints, remember monsters' AC or other menial tasks. Tyr does it for you. 

Tyr is an incarnation of a command line tool that I have personally used for over a hundred sessions. I decided that terminal applications are not necessarily the best way to distribute your work, thus I began writing Tyr one evening.
